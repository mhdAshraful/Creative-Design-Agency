# Landing Page: Framfolio

This is one of my casestudy project. THis is build with React + NextJs ecocystem inaddition to that i have used Tailwind CSS & Typescript to give it a concrete code base. This is well documented and components are resuable for different sections.

To run the development server:

first download the git repository then

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

this will serve the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
Open it with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
